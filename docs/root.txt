About This Documentation
------------------------

This guide was produced by the Evergreen Documentation Interest Group (DIG),
consisting of numerous volunteers from many different organizations. The DIG
has drawn together, edited, and supplemented pre-existing documentation
contributed by libraries and consortia running Evergreen that were kind enough
to release their documentation into the creative commons. Please see the
<<attributions,Attributions>> section for a full list of authors and
contributing organizations. Just like the software it describes, this guide is
a work in progress, continually revised to meet the needs of its users, so if
you find errors or omissions, please let us know, by contacting the DIG
facilitators at docs@evergreen-ils.org.

This guide to Evergreen is intended to meet the needs of front-line library
staff, catalogers, library administrators, system administrators, and software
developers. It is organized into Parts, Chapters, and Sections addressing key
aspects of the software, beginning with the topics of broadest interest to the
largest groups of users and progressing to some of the more specialized and
technical topics of interest to smaller numbers of users.

Copies of this guide can be accessed in PDF and HTML formats from http://docs.evergreen-ils.org/.

About Evergreen
---------------

Evergreen is an open source library automation software designed to meet the
needs of the very smallest to the very largest libraries and consortia. Through
its staff interface, it facilitates the management, cataloging, and circulation
of library materials, and through its online public access interface it helps
patrons find those materials.

The Evergreen software is freely licensed under the GNU General Public License,
meaning that it is free to download, use, view, modify, and share. It has an
active development and user community, as well as several companies offering
migration, support, hosting, and development services.

The community’s development requirements state that Evergreen must be:

* Stable, even under extreme load.
* Robust, and capable of handling a high volume of transactions and simultaneous users.
* Flexible, to accommodate the varied needs of libraries.
* Secure, to protect our patrons’ privacy and data.
* User-friendly, to facilitate patron and staff use of the system.

Evergreen, which first launched in 2006 now powers over 544 libraries of every
type – public, academic, special, school, and even tribal and home libraries –
in over a dozen countries worldwide.

Web Client Preview
==================

Introduction
------------

The Evergreen Web Staff Client is in the early stages of development and is
being provided as a "preview" version beginning in Evergreen version 2.7.  If
you are an early adopter, thank you!  Please keep in mind:

  . *We want your feedback!* Please report any errors, bugs, strange behavior,
etc. using https://bugs.launchpad.net/evergreen/[Launchpad]. And please send
requested features or design improvements to the
mailto:open-ils-dev@list.georgialibraries.org[Evergreen Developers email list].

  . *It is changing rapidly.* Features are being added in "sprints" grouped by
workflow. Read the
http://evergreen-ils.org/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=dev:browser_staff:dev_sprints[development
wiki page] and watch the
http://libmail.georgialibraries.org/mailman/listinfo/open-ils-general[general
email list] for updates. (However, these changes will only appear on your client
when your version of Evergreen is upgraded. Ask your server administrator for
details.)

  . *The design may change significantly.* Initially, it will follow the design
of the current XUL-based staff client. But the browser framework provides more
flexibility for design choices. Also, Evergreen hired an
http://lima-julia.tumblr.com/EG-style-guide[intern] from December 2014 through
March 2015 to create a
http://evergreen-ils.org/documentation/previews/proposed_style_guide.html[User
Interface Style Guide]. Watch http://evergreen-ils.org/communicate/irc/[IRC] and the
http://libmail.georgialibraries.org/mailman/listinfo/open-ils-general[general
email list] to follow the progress.

The following rationale was published in the Release Notes for Evergreen 2.7:
====
The 2.7 release will contain a preview of web client circulation features.
Circulation is the first step in moving all staff functions from the existing
XULRunner-based client to a web application that will be based on AngularJS.

Evergreen is moving away from the existing client because XULRunner no longer
supports features critical to the Evergreen software, including remote XUL,
multi-part streaming, and XML JavaScript. The new web client is expected to show
some speed improvements, to provide comprehensive support for
internationalization/localization, to provide good support for assistive
technologies, to be easier to customize locally, and to be more mobile friendly.

The intent of the preview is to make it easier for end users at Evergreen sites
to try the new client, become familiar with its features, and to discover/report
bugs that are found. Instructions to implement the web client can be found in
the code in Open-ILS/web/js/ui/default/staff/README.install. These will be
revised and moved to the full README for 2.7.1.
====

Evergreen 2.9 includes the following improvements to the web client preview:
====
The web staff client now includes additional functionality to support
cataloging and item maintenance, including:

- a new MARC editor
- the service backing the authority headings chooser now has the ability
  to filter the browse by subject thesaurus
- Z39.50 search and record import
- improvements to copy and record bucket functionality
- embedding the link checker interface
- embedding the MARC batch import/export interface
- the web staff volume/copy editor

Nearly all of the cataloging functionality available in the XUL staff client is
now present in the web staff client with the exception of printing spine
labels. Nonetheless, the web staff client remains a preview and is not
recommended for production use.

Using the Public Access Catalog
===============================

Introduction
------------

Evergreen has a public OPAC that meets WCAG guidelines (http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag), which helps make the OPAC accessible to users with a range of disabilities. This part of the documentation explains how to use the Evergreen public OPAC. It covers the basic catalog and more advanced search topics. It also describes the ``My Account'' tools users have to find information and manage their personal library accounts through the OPAC. This section could be used by staff and patrons but would be more useful for staff as a generic reference when developing custom guides and tutorials for their users.
